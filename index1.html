            Dear sir the reason of this letter is tell you the benefits of html which are 1. HTML is Easy to Learn and Use
            HTML is very easy to learn and understand. HTML is the first and foremost language that the person will go through for the one who is learning web development. It has simple tags, and there is no hectic of case sensitivity in HTML. It simply has some tags that serve a specific purpose, and that’s it. One can easily understand other’s code and can make changes in it if required as there is not a lot more to understand in it. Moreover, it does not throw any error or create any problem like other programming languages if the developer forgets to close the tags or make some mistakes in code.
            
            2. HTML is Free
            One of the biggest advantages of HTML is that it is free of cost, and there is no need to purchase specific software. One should not have to deal with different plugins required to work on any software as HTML does not require any plugins. So it is very cost-effective from a per business perspective as there is no cost of purchasing the license if the whole website is developed in HTML language.
