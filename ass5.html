            Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, understand, and manage one's own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It involves the ability to recognize and express emotions in a healthy and productive way, and to use emotions to guide thinking and behavior. Emotional intelligence is a key factor in building strong relationships, achieving success in personal and professional life, and in developing resilience and well-being. It includes skills such as self-awareness, empathy, emotional regulation, and social skills. People who possess high emotional intelligence are often effective communicators, problem solvers, and leaders, and are better equipped to manage stress and navigate complex social situations.

            PEOPLE WITHOUT EQ

        <p>
            People who lack emotional intelligence (EQ) may struggle to understand and manage their own emotions, and may have difficulty navigating social situations and building strong relationships. They may have a hard time empathizing with others, understanding different perspectives, and regulating their emotions in a healthy way. This can lead to conflict in personal and professional relationships, as well as increased stress and anxiety. People with low EQ may also struggle with decision-making, as they may not be able to effectively weigh emotional factors when making choices. However, it's important to note that emotional intelligence is a skill that can be developed with practice and training.  <br>
